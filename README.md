# The Three Layer GAN
The first nerual network is fed data and generates outputs on that data
The second nerual network takes the data from the first and trains on it improving it
The thrid nerual network takes the data from the third and improves on it.
This cycle can repeat indefeintly to allow an AI system that is exteremely good at something while also being exteremly lightweight on system usage
# DISCLAMER:
This architecture, known as the "Three Layer GAN," is a concept that is currently being researched and is not yet proven to be stable or effective. It is important to note that any implementation of this architecture may not perform as expected and may not be suitable for use in real-world applications. It is recommended that further research and testing be conducted before attempting to use this architecture in any production environment. Additionally, it should not be used in any safety-critical applications. Use this architecture at your own risk.
